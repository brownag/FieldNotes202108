#### Description:

Soil scientists spend valuable time getting to know soils and the landscapes they occur in by digging and describing soils in the field. In many areas soil properties vary nearly continuously in a complex pattern and over short spatial scales—making geostatistical/quantitative assessment of spatial variability in the field impractical. To integrate variance between and within individual observations tacit experience of soil scientists is employed. In this context, I ask the question: How can routine field observations be leveraged to better justify to our users the choices made in correlation of soil map units?

U.S. Soil Survey has been a leader in development and dissemination of standard protocols for soil description. Over time the needs for soil survey have been tested and refined to make a robust system for describing soil conditions on the Standard Form 232. In this presentation I evaluate some new tools for assessing variability of boundaries between horizons and the implications for aggregate interpretations of the data. The demonstration centers on some geometric assumptions applied to standard classes of horizon distinctness or topography. Prototypes of these algorithms have been implemented in the aqp R package for testing and discussion.

The presentation will address field data recently collected in the Mariposa County Area (CA649) by Sonora, California MLRA Soil Survey Office staff. I hope that this presentation can be the start of a conversation around the applicability (or lack thereof) of sensitivity analysis techniques in typical NASIS soil horizons; potential new data elements to describe soil local variability; and implications for the “purity” of map unit concepts (for both traditional and non-traditional soil survey applications).
